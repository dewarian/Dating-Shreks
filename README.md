# Dating-App

#### Hey Shrek!
What nice of you to look at our app. This is a dating app, well actually, This is just a feature we made for the Dating app
We are going to make later on. So the feature we made consists of a system which is kind of like a login. You make a username
and after that you will have to fill in which of the 3 movies (which appear) you like. That gets saved in a database and you
have created a user + movie preferences!

## Installation
For installing this app you will need to do the following:
1. Clone all the documents found in the repository and put them in a map
2. Open your Terminal/CMD and look for the map
3. When opened enter the following in the Terminal/CMD _(You will need to install npm for this, if not yet installed. Do so with this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm))_
```js
npm install
```
4. Then, to open the app, enter the following command in the Terminal/CMD (this still has to happen in the correct path)
```js
node server.js
```
5. Then open your browser (whichever one you prefer) and typ in the following:
```js
http://localhost:3000
```
#### 6. It works!
